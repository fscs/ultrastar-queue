Song Licensor: Silver Note
07.01.2015:
Hope you all had a good Christmas and New Years! This song is inspired by the CMC. It's about not knowing where you fit into the bigger picture. It's partly frustration, and it's partly determination - you're not gonna let life just slide by you until it's too late - it's now or never to start living.

The track morphed a lot over the course of its construction, but I knew from the start that I wanted a rock song with plenty of guitars. No genre-bending this time. I have been triple tracking the vocals on my previous songs, but for this one I decided to try mono and just play with effects to make it sound stereo - I prefer this where possible because it sounds tighter. I've tried this before but haven't been able to pull it off. This time I think I have. I started this song in early November, so, yeah, I'm glad it's finally finished :P On to the next song now! Making all of this music has been such a thrill, I love doing it. I think I've found my mark.

Yes I tried to Photoshop the background so it looks like "CMC" is written in the dirt..

To Jesus be the glory.

Lyrics:
You don't know where you fit in.
Everyone seems to know who they are,
But who are you? Who are you?

You have tried everything, 
but time will tell, what you always knew.

It is now or never, there's no tomorrow,
It is now or never, not gonna wait,
It is now or never, there's no tomorrow,
It is now or never, not gonna wait.

You feel like a ghost without a haunt,
Watch the world spinning round.

All you want, to be a part, 
Find your place, to find your mark.
But you're a fool, yeah you're a fool.
