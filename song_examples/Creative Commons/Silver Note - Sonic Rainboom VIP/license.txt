20.02.2016:
"Thanks to HolyKop (and others) I've decided to remaster and re-release this song. Hopefully this has better audio quality but still preserves the spirit of the original. And yes the FiM remix is also still... coming.. eventually.. haha :P

To Jesus be the glory.

Lyrics:
There's nothing to fear, just open your ears,
louder, louder.

Super speed now, like a sonic rainboom,
faster, faster.

'Cause we're flying high, 
higher, higher. 

You know you know it's yours to take.
Things will never be the same.
Train hard, till there's nothing left,
Till they know your name.
There's nothing to fear, just open your eyes, feel the adrenaline pumping.

Everyone is watching you (watching you).
Can you feel the wind rush under your wings? (Your wings).
This is your time now (your time).
Time to show the world (oh)."
